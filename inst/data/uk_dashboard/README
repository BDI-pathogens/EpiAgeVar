The data in this directory was downloaded from the UK Government webiste from
the url https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/covid-19-archive-data-download
on 17th July 2024 at 13:00 BST. 

The data is an archive of all the data which was availabe on the UK Dashboard
website throughout the pandemic and is 1.5Gb (zipped).

For the purposes of this package we only contain the small subset of the data
which we use in the modelling. Note, unfortunately some of the sumamry files in the 
archive have missing data, therefore certain timeseries needs to be aggregated from
more underlying data.
